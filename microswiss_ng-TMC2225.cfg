# Obtaining rotation_distance from steps_per_mm (or step_distance)
#
# The designers of your 3d printer originally calculated steps_per_mm from a rotation distance.
# If you know the steps_per_mm then it is possible to use this general formula to obtain that original rotation distance:
#
# rotation_distance = <full_steps_per_rotation> * <microsteps> / <steps_per_mm>
#
# Or, if you have an older Klipper configuration and know the step_distance parameter you can use this formula:
#
# rotation_distance = <full_steps_per_rotation> * <microsteps> * <step_distance>
#
# The <full_steps_per_rotation> setting is determined from the type of stepper motor.
# Most stepper motors are "1.8 degree steppers" and therefore have 200 full steps per rotation (360 divided by 1.8 is 200).
# Some stepper motors are "0.9 degree steppers" and thus have 400 full steps per rotation.
# Other stepper motors are rare.
# If unsure, do not set full_steps_per_rotation in the config file and use 200 in the formula above.
#
# The <microsteps> setting is determined by the stepper motor driver.
# Most drivers use 16 microsteps.
# If unsure, set microsteps: 16 in the config and use 16 in the formula above.

# Microswiss NG uses 1.8Â° NEMA17 stepper motor
# full_steps_per_rotation: 200
# steps_per_mm: 400

# On the Creality3D Motherboard v4.2.7
# The letters hand written on the card reader slot (in marker pen) are different depending on which type of stepper driver is installed.
# These are for V4.2.2 & V4.2.7 boards with the STM32F103RET6 micro controller:
# C = HR4988
# E = A4988
# A = TMC2208
# B = TMC2209
# H = TMC2225 (microsteps: 16)
# T5 = TMC2225
# T8 = TMC2208
